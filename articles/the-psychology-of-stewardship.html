        <h2>Opening Reflection</h2>
        <p>Most people think about money in moments. This month’s paycheck. This quarter’s returns. This year’s bonus. But stewardship isn’t about moments. It’s about decades. It’s about continuity. It’s about responsibility across time.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>Short-Term Thinking vs. Long-Term Responsibility</h2>
        <p>Short-term thinking is loud. It’s about chasing, reacting, grabbing. It feels urgent, but it rarely builds anything that lasts. Stewardship is quiet. It’s about holding, preserving, guiding. It feels slower, but it creates structures that endure.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>Stewardship as Identity</h2>
        <p>Stewardship isn’t ownership. Ownership says: “this is mine.” Stewardship says: “this is entrusted to me.” It’s not about accumulation. It’s about responsibility. It’s about seeing wealth not as a prize, but as a promise.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>Thinking in Decades</h2>
        <p>When you think in decades, decisions change. You stop asking: “what can I gain today?” You start asking: “what will remain tomorrow?” Decade thinking builds resilience. It prevents panic. It creates dignity. It ensures that wealth is not just grown, but sustained.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h2>The Quiet Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Stewardship is psychology. It’s the mindset that transforms wealth from ownership into continuity. It’s the shift from chasing moments to shaping decades. And that’s the paradox: the most powerful financial choices aren’t about what you own. They’re about how you think. Quietly. Deliberately. Across time.</p>
