        <h3>Beyond the Transaction</h3>
        <p>
            The financial industry is often noisy. It speaks in the language of returns, 
            outperformance, and urgency. It asks, <em>"How much can we make?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            My practice begins with a different question: <em>"What is the purpose of this wealth?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            For Muslim families, this answer is rarely just about numbers. It is about <strong>Barakah</strong> 
            (blessings), <strong>Protection</strong> (of lineage and dignity), and <strong>Legacy</strong> 
            (what we leave behind).
        </p>
        <p>
            I work as a guide for families who seek to align their financial decisions with their values. 
            We do not chase trends. We build structures—takaful, investments, and estate plans—that 
            stand firm against uncertainty, allowing you to focus on your worship, your family, and your work.
